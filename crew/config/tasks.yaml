    major product launches, groundbreaking research publications, policy and regulatory updates, 
    funding announcements, partnership deals, practical AI implementations, industry analysis, 
    and emerging trends. Prioritize content that offers both immediate relevance and longer-term 
    strategic value to AI professionals, business leaders, and technology enthusiasts.
    
    Ensure topic diversity across different AI sectors (NLP, computer vision, robotics, ML ops, 
    AI safety, etc.) and stakeholder perspectives (researchers, practitioners, policymakers, end users).

    - top_stories: A curated list of 2-3 concise but detailed news stories covering the most significant AI developments of the week
    - deep_dive: One substantial, analytical story that deserves comprehensive exploration and provides strategic context
